# üî• Battleship: AI Edition üî•

Welcome to Battleship: AI Edition! This is a classic game of Battleship with a modern twist, now supercharged with multiple game modes and strategic abilities. The project features a full-stack application with a Django backend that powers the game logic, a React frontend for an interactive user experience, and a powerful AI opponent driven by the Ollama framework. The entire application is containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Battleship Gameplay**: The timeless naval strategy game you know and love.
* **Player vs. Player (PvP)**: Battle against a friend on the same machine.
* **Player vs. AI (PvA)**: Test your skills against a smart AI opponent.
* **"Hunter-Killer" AI**: The AI uses an advanced strategy. Once it scores a hit, it intelligently hunts in adjacent cells to sink the ship before searching elsewhere.
* **New Game Mode: Salvo**: A chaotic and fast-paced mode where players fire a number of shots equal to their number of surviving ships.
* **Power-Up System (Optional)**: Spice up your matches with three unique, one-time-use abilities:
    * **‚úàÔ∏è Scout Plane**: Reveals a random 2x2 area of the enemy's grid.
    * **üöÄ Torpedo**: Fires a shot that travels across an entire row or column, hitting the first ship in its path.
    * **‚ö° EMP Blast**: Disables your opponent's systems, forcing them to miss a turn.
